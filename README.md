# STROBOSCOPIC_DONUT :coffee::doughnut:
A "simple" stroboscopic donut 

It's not actually the simplest thing I have implemented ;)

It require to know:
  - Calculus 2,
  - Numpy,
  - Signal processing (filters, energy of a signal),
  - Other algorithm to do peak detection in realtime data (z-score) 
  
...and have a bit of creativity to put together all this stuff for a good result
